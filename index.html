            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>Newcastle, as part of the English Core Cities Group, has experienced a significant transformation from its industrial past to a lively, service-oriented city. This change is visible in the revitalization of its urban spaces, particularly the renovations of Marks and Spencer and Eldon Square. These projects have improved the functionality and accessibility of these important landmarks, showing how Newcastle is adapting its urban development. O'Donnell (2008) suggests that our urban cultural landscape is a shared heritage resource, where legacy and managed change can coexist to support both contemporary and future urban vitality. Newcastle's current path seems to embody this idea, showing a dedication to preserving its cultural identity while moving forward. The city manages to preserve its rich heritage while also embracing modern advancements, as seen in the ongoing work on HMRC headquarters and the planned Hotel Gotham. While these developments bring economic growth and job opportunities, they also raise concerns about potential downsides, like increasing property prices. The brief implementation of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) scheme highlights the city's commitment to environmental sustainability. The StoryMap's design, using a green colour scheme matches Newcastle's goal of sustainable development, and placing old and new photographs side by side shows the city's impressive transformation. The StoryMap shows the link between Newcastle's changing fortunes and its evolving identity. By focusing on sites like Marks and Spencer, Eldon Square, and the planned HMRC headquarters, it highlights the city's shift from an industrial base to a service-oriented economy. Mapping these sites offers a visual way to understand this transformation, highlighting the spatial effects of Newcastle's economic and cultural changes. The peaceful and nostalgic theme reflects the city's rich heritage, while the choice of videos emphasizes the dynamic nature of Newcastle's transformation. The Storymap also captures the essence of Newcastle's transformation, showcasing its ability to balance preservation and progress. The critical commentary highlights the effectiveness of the Storymap's design and content in conveying the city's evolving identity and its commitment to sustainable development.</p>
