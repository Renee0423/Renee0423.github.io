            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>Newcastle, as part of the English Core Cities Group, has experienced a significant transformation from its industrial past to a lively, service-oriented city. This change is visible in the revitalization of its urban spaces, particularly the renovations of Marks and Spencer and Eldon Square. These projects have improved the functionality and accessibility of these important landmarks, showing how Newcastle is adapting its urban development. O'Donnell (2008) suggests that our urban cultural landscape is a shared heritage resource, where legacy and managed change can coexist to support both contemporary and future urban vitality. Newcastle's current path seems to embody this idea, showing a dedication to preserving its cultural identity while moving forward. The city manages to preserve its rich heritage while also embracing modern advancements, as seen in the ongoing work on HMRC headquarters and the planned Hotel Gotham. While these developments bring economic growth and job opportunities, they also raise concerns about potential downsides, like increasing property prices. The brief implementation of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) scheme highlights the city's commitment to environmental sustainability. The StoryMap's design, using a green colour scheme matches Newcastle's goal of sustainable development, and placing old and new photographs side by side shows the city's impressive transformation. The StoryMap shows the link between Newcastle's changing fortunes and its evolving identity. By focusing on sites like Marks and Spencer, Eldon Square, and the planned HMRC headquarters, it highlights the city's shift from an industrial base to a service-oriented economy. Mapping these sites offers a visual way to understand this transformation, highlighting the spatial effects of Newcastle's economic and cultural changes. The peaceful and nostalgic theme reflects the city's rich heritage, while the choice of videos emphasizes the dynamic nature of Newcastle's transformation. The Storymap also captures the essence of Newcastle's transformation, showcasing its ability to balance preservation and progress. The critical commentary highlights the effectiveness of the Storymap's design and content in conveying the city's evolving identity and its commitment to sustainable development.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>In this session, I explored the average salaries of men and women in the UK over several years, segmented by regions, academic fields, and academic levels, culminating in a Data Story. Utilizing various visualizations, I selected the more suitable visualization for each dataset to accurately portray the underlying trends. For instance, when crafting the "Comparing Average Salaries by Gender and Region" visualization, which involved multiple years, regions, and comparisons between genders, a bar chart provided the most intuitive representation of the data. Additionally, in designing the "Average Salaries by Function and Gender" visualization, a scatter plot effectively illustrated the passage of time and changes in salaries. Building upon the imperative of visualizing data, the presence of numbers alone may not always suffice, as they can be as subjective as text. Visualizations offer a more objective and engaging means of presenting data, allowing for easier observation of trends and patterns over time (Kohnstamm & Cairo, 2013). Dynamic time series visualization, in particular, offers distinct advantages in showcasing changes over time and facilitating a deeper understanding of data evolution. To further extend and improve this project, several avenues could be explored. Firstly, seeking additional data to broaden the scope of the data story, such as including more years or regions, could enhance its comprehensiveness. Secondly, exploring different visualization tools and techniques to create more diverse and compelling charts could add depth to the narrative. Additionally, optimizing animation effects to be smoother and more captivating could elevate the overall presentation. Finally, enhancing user engagement by incorporating interactive elements, such as allowing users to explore different aspects of the data through clicks or scrolls, could enhance the overall user experience and increase retention. These improvements would contribute to enhancing the quality and value of the data story.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Image Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Initial Prompt:</p>
            <p class="content">The university classroom is filled with different students participating in digital culture lessons that represent different aspects of digital culture.</p>

            </ul>
        
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Audio Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Using elevenlabs.io, I generated AI voice. I used various tone options to adjust the pitch to ensure the audio sounded more engaging.</p>
        
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Transcript Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Using Gemini, I generated the text, and based on this text, I created the transcript. I added prompts related to tone adjustments (e.g., more lively) to improve the output.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>In making this session, the most time-consuming aspect was generating AI image content. Although the initial prompt was "different students", the outcome predominantly featured male Caucasian individuals. Therefore, I supplemented the prompt with "different cultural backgrounds" to ensure a more diverse representation. This adjustment aligns with Gillespie's (2014) concept of "algorithmic discrimination", where algorithms may inadvertently reinforce existing biases. The limitations of the image generation tool highlight the current immaturity of AI in accurately depicting facial features and diversity, often resulting in distorted facial representations. Furthermore, the AI-generated content exhibited varying degrees of success and limitations across different modalities. While text generation efficiently crafted a message emphasizing the program's inclusivity and appeal to diverse audiences, the image generation tool struggled to accurately represent diversity, resulting in images that predominantly featured male Caucasian individuals. Despite its limitations, the image generation tool's ability to produce visuals based on textual prompts could be beneficial for individuals lacking artistic skills. However, it raises concerns biases, and copyright infringement. Conversely, the audio generation tool performed admirably, producing natural-sounding voice recordings that effectively conveyed the promotional message. The AI-generated voice closely resembled that of a human speaker, showcasing the advancement of audio generation technology. Nevertheless, the sophistication of audio generation technology also presents risks, as it could be exploited for fraudulent purposes or to manipulate individuals. Overall, while AI tools offer valuable assistance in content creation, they are not without limitations. The discrepancies in representation across different modalities underscore the need for human oversight and intervention to ensure inclusivity and mitigate algorithmic biases. Furthermore, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI Development (2018) emphasizes fairness, accountability, and transparency as core principles. The session could benefit from referencing these principles in relation to AI content creation, the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI-generated content necessitate ongoing research and discussion on AI and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</p>
